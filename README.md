# Advents of code

This is my repository for my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges 🎄⭐️🎅🏻.
Solutions may be in either Rust, that I am learning or Python.

For each language, one can find the appropriate framework working as follows.
Each file require three functions:
- `generator` : takes the puzzle input, and transforms it in an appropriate parsing and modifcations to solve the puzzle.
- `part_1`: takes the puzzle input returned by `generator` and returns the answer for part one of the challenge.
- `part_2`: takes the puzzle input returned by `generator` and returns the answer for part two of the challenge.

To run a Rust file, place yourself in the `Rust_framework` directory and enter following command:
```bash
cargo r --bin <day> 
```
For a Python file, place yourself in the `Python_framework` directory and enter the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py <day> 
```
