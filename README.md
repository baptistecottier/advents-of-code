# Advents of code

Here you can find my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges 🎄⭐️🎅🏻.


### __Python Solutions__

To run solutions, you have to a run a script. You can find a minimal working script as `aoc_mw`. You can also add features as automatic input download and save using a cookie session, answer verification (available only once the puzzle is solved, but may be useful for optimisations), etc... You can save the script in the `/usr/local/bin/` folder and make it executable from anywhere by running `chmod u+x aoc_mw`. To solve the day `d` of year `y`,run `aoc_mw y d`.
